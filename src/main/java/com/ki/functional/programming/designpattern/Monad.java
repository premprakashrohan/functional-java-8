/*
 *
 * In Java, monads are not built into the language itself, but certain libraries
 * and frameworks allow you to work with monad-like structures. One such example
 * is the Optional class in Java, which can be considered as a monad. Let's
 * demonstrate a simple example using Optional as a monad:
 * 
 * In this example, we define a divide function that takes two integers as input
 * and returns the division result wrapped in an Optional. If the divisor is
 * zero, the function returns an empty Optional to indicate a failure or the
 * absence of a value. Otherwise, it calculates the division result and wraps it
 * in an Optional.
 * 
 * In the main method, we use the divide function and handle the result using
 * the Optional methods isPresent and get. The isPresent method checks if the
 * Optional contains a value, and get retrieves the value if it is present.
 * 
 * Please note that while this example demonstrates the concept of a monad using
 * Optional, monads are a more general concept found in functional programming
 * languages, and there are other monads like Maybe, Either, and IO in languages
 * like Haskell and Scala. Java's Optional is just one specific example of a
 * monad-like construct that provides some of the benefits of monads, such as
 * handling absence and failure in a more structured and composable way.
