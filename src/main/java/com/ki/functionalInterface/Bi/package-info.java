/**
 * Functional interfaces have a single functionality to exhibit. For example, a Comparable interface with a single method ‘compareTo’ is used for comparison purpose. Java 8 has defined a lot of functional interfaces to be used extensively in lambda expressions. Following is the list of functional interfaces defined in java.util.Function package.

 * 
 * 1 BiConsumer<T,U> Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments, and returns no result.
2 	BiFunction<T,U,R> Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
3 	

BinaryOperator<T>

Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
4
