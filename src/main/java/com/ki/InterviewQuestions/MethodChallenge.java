        // The first one should be called calculateHighScorePosition
        // It should have one parameter, score which is an int
        // The method should return an value that is calculated based
        // on the score.
        // 1 if the score is >= 1000
        // 2 if the score is >= 500 and < 1000
        // 3 if the score is >= 100 and < 500
        // 4 in all other cases
        //
        // The second method should be called displayHighScorePosition
        // it should have two parameters, name and position
        // name is the players name and a String.
        // position is the value returned from the first method and
        // represents where in the high score table
        // the players score belongs.
        //
        // This method does not return anything, rather, it outputs
        // information about the player and the position.
        // Output should be
        // <Name> managed to get to position <Position> on the high score table.
        // <Name> and <Position> would be replaced with the actual name
        // and position passed to the method.
        // If the arguments passed to displayHighScorePosition
        // were Tim and 2, then the output should be
        // Tim managed to get to position 2 on the high score table.
        //
        // call calculateHighScorePosition four times, passing the score
        // 1500, 900, 400, and 50.
        // Save the value returned from the method and pass it along with a player name
        // to displayHighScorePosition.
